description: My research interests lie at the intersection of **robotics**, **computer vision**, and **machine learning**, including sensing and perception, mapping and localization, navigation and exploration, multiagent systems, human-robot interaction, 3D computer vision, neural rendering (NeRF and 3DGS), self-supervised learning, foundation models (VFMs, VLMs, MLLMs), generative models, adversarial learning, uncertainty quantification, and dataset curation. My works have been published in top-tier venues such as **CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, RSS, CoRL, ICRA, IROS, and RA-L**, with multiple first-author papers selected for **spotlight**, **highlight**, and **oral** presentations. I also serve as an Associate Editor for IROS and as a reviewer for these top venues.
