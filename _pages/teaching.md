title: lectures
description:  I have taken courses from multiple departments (ME/EE/CS) at NYU Tandon and NYU Courant, such as computer graphics, optimal control and RL, localization and navigation, swarm robotics, robot perception, and the mathematics of deep learning. I have also collaborated with experts from diverse fields such as robotics, signal processing, vision & graphics, cybersecurity, and mechanical & civil engineering. This interdisciplinary training equips me to design and teach courses that bridge theoretical AI/ML foundations with practical robotics and engineering applications, preparing students to address practical problems using AI.
