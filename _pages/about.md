<!-- [I am on the job market! Please feel free to contact me if you think I could be a good fit. Thank you :)]() -->

I am a 4th-year PhD student at <a href='https://ai4ce.github.io'>NYU AI4CE Lab</a> led by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YeG8ZM0AAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Chen Feng</a>, and a visiting scholar at <a href='http://group.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~marslab/#/'>Tsinghua IIIS MARS Lab</a> led by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DmahiOYAAAAJ'>Prof. Hang Zhao</a>. I am also a research scientist intern at NVIDIA Research, working with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Oyx-_UIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Jose M. Alvarez</a> in the <a href='https://alvarezlopezjosem.github.io'>Autonmous Vehicle Perception Research Group</a>, <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1VI_oYUAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Zhiding Yu</a> in the <a href='https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/'>Learning and Perception Research Group</a>, and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v-AEFIEAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Yue Wang</a> in the <a href='https://nvr-avg.github.io/'>Autonmous Vehicle Research Group</a>. Before that, I had the opportunity to work as a research intern at NVIDIA AI Research advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bEcLezcAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Anima Anandkumar</a> in 2022, and a visiting scholar at Shanghai Jiao Tong University advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W_Q33RMAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Siheng Chen</a> in 2021.

My research vision is to enable ***collaborative autonomous intelligence*** by empowering robots with human-level **spatial**, **social**, and **self-awareness**, allowing them to actively perceive and plan in unstructured environments, interact effectively with humans or other robots, and leverage as well as augment the associated memory. To this end, I draw from vision, learning, robotics, graphics, language, sensing, data science, and cognitive science. My research works include developing **robust, efficient, and scalable** computational models for *3D scene parsing and decision-making* from high-dimensional sensory input, as well as **curating large-scale datasets** to effectively train and verify these models for practical applications, including but not limited to *connected and autonomous vehicles, assistive and service robotics, and construction automation*. I divide my research into several interconnected directions, each with its focus.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
