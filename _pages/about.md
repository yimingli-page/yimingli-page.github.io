I am a Dean's PhD Fellow at NYU, advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YeG8ZM0AAAAJ&hl=en'>Institute Associate Professor Chen Feng</a> and collaborating with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y2GtJkAAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Saining Xie</a>. I am also a Graduate Fellow at NVIDIA Research, working on world simulators and foundation models with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RhOpyXcAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Marco Pavone</a> at Stanford University. I am fortunate to collaborate with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=1VI_oYUAAAAJ'>Dr. Zhiding Yu</a> from the <a href='https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/'>Learning and Perception Research Group</a>, as well as <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8KsqL4gAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Zan Gojcjc</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CUlqK5EAAAAJ'>Prof. Sanja Fidler</a> at the <a href='https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/'>Toronto AI Lab</a>.

Previously, I spent some time at NVIDIA Applied AV Research with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Oyx-_UIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Jose M. Alvarez</a>, NVIDIA AI Research with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bEcLezcAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Anima Anandkumar</a> at Caltech in 2022, Tsinghua MARS Lab with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DmahiOYAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Hang Zhao</a>, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W_Q33RMAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Siheng Chen</a>.


My research vision is to *replicate human-like spatial cognition with minimal human supervision*, paving the way for trustworthy and accessible autonomous robots and embodied agents to work *for* and *around* humans. My ongoing research activities are in three dimensions: **(1) agent**: building a generalist embodied visual agent powered by foundation models to perceive and interact with the 3D world; **(2) world**: building a photorealistic world simulator to train and evaluate the embodied agents and foundation models; **(3) data**: visual-spatial and multimodal data collection in the real world by robots and humans.
