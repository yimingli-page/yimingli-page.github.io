I am a Dean's PhD Fellow at NYU, where I am advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YeG8ZM0AAAAJ&hl=en'>Institute Associate Professor Chen Feng</a> and collaborate with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y2GtJkAAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Saining Xie</a>. I am also an NVIDIA Graduate Fellow at <a href='https://research.nvidia.com/labs/avg/'>Autonmous Vehicle Research Group</a>, advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RhOpyXcAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Marco Pavone</a> at Stanford University. I am also fortunate to collaborate with <a href='https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/'>Toronto AI Lab</a> led by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CUlqK5EAAAAJ'>Prof. Sanja Fidler</a>. 

Previously, I had the opportunity to work as an intern at NVIDIA AV Perception Research led by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Oyx-_UIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Jose M. Alvarez</a> in 2023 and NVIDIA AI Research led by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bEcLezcAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Anima Anandkumar</a> at Caltech in 2022, and a research assistant at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W_Q33RMAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Siheng Chen</a> in 2021 and Tsinghua University advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DmahiOYAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Hang Zhao</a> in 2020.


My research vision is to *replicate human-like spatial cognition with minimal human supervision*, paving the way for trustworthy and accessible autonomous robots and embodied agents capable of addressing grand societal challenges in practical domains such as transportation and healthcare. My ongoing research activities are in three dimensions: (1) **agent**: building a generalist embodied visual agent powered by foundation models to perceive and interact with the 3D world; (2) **world**: building a photorealistic world simulator to train and evaluate the embodied agents and foundation models; (3) **data**: visual-spatial and multimodal data collection in the real world by robots and humans.
